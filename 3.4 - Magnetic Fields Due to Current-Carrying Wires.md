# Example 1: Torque on a Loop of Wire

  -  A loop of wire carrying current I is placed in a magnetic field.
     Determine the net torque around the axis of rotation due to the
     current in the wire.

# Magnetic Field due to a Current-Carrying Wire

  -  Moving charges create magnetic fields

  -  Current-carrying wires carry moving charges, therefore they create
     B fields

  -  Direction given by right-hand rule

  -  For multiple wires, determine B field from each and add them up
     using superposition

  -  B fields may interact with other moving charges, so
     current-carrying wires can exert forces upon each other.

# First Right Hand Rule

 ![EIe«ric сштетн В Мадпсьслсм В ](./media/image383.jpg)

  -  "Hold" wire with your right hand, thumb in direction of positive
     current flow

  -  Your fingers wrap in the direction of the magnetic
     field

# Example 2: Magnetic Field due to a Wire

  -  A wire carries a current of 6 amperes to the left.

  -  Find the magnetic field at point P, located 0.1 meters below the
     wire

# Force Between Parallel Current-Carrying Wires

  -  Use right hand rules to determine force between parallel
     current-carrying wires

  -  Find magnetic field due to first wire. Draw it.

  -  Find direction of force on second wire due to current in second
     wire. Force on the first wire will be equal and opposite (Newton's
     third Law)

# Gauss's Law for Magnetism

  -  You can never draw a closed surface with any net magnetic flux
     because there are no magnetic monopoles.

  -  This is the basis of Gauss's Law for Magnetism (Maxwell's second
     equation)

# Example 3: Field due to Wires

  -  Two long current-carrying wires are separated by a distance d as
     shown.

  -  What is the net magnetic field due to these wires at point P,
     located midway between the two wires, if the top wire carries a
     current of 3A and the bottom wire caries a current of 5A.

# Example 4: Force on a Wire

  -  A 5-m long straight wire runs at a 45-degree angle to a uniform
     magnetic field of 5 T. If the force on the wire is 1N, determine
     the current in the
     wire
