# Question 43

 ![43. A potential difference V is maintained between two large,
 parallel conducting plates. An electron starts from rest on the
 surface of one plate and accelerates toward the other. Its speed as it
 reaches the second plate is proportional to 2 ](./media/image551.png)

# Question 53

 ![53. A charged particle can move with constant velocity through a
 region containing both an electric field and a magnetic field only if
 the A (B) (D) (E) electric field is arallel to the ma etic field
 electric field is perpendicular to the magnetic field electric field
 is parallel to the velocity vector magnetic field is parallel to the
 velocity vector magnetic field is perpendicular to the velocity vector
 ](./media/image555.png)
 
 ![Because the forces caused by the two fields must be in opposite
 directions in order to add to zero, and since the force of the
 magnetic field is perpendicular to the magnetic field and the force of
 the electric field is in the same line as that of the field, the two
 fields must be perpendicular. ](./media/image556.png)

 are held fixed and are equally spaced around the circumference of a
 circle of radius R. ](./media/image558.png)

 required to bring a seventh panicle of charge + Q from very far away
 and place it at the center of the circle? (B) 41t€o 3 3 (D) 21t€o (E)

 the (A) electric field is zero everywhere inside the (B) (C) (D) (E)

 not touch, the initially uncharged electroscope shown above, the
 leaves spring apart (I). When the electroscope is then touched with a
 finger, the leaves collapse (Il). When next the finger and finally the
 rod are removed, the leaves spring apart a second time (Ill). The
 charge on the leaves is (B) C D (E) positive in both I and Ill

 are allowed to go to ground, so in Ill the leaves have a net positive
 charge. ](./media/image564.png)

# Question 70

 ![x x x PI x x x Copper x x x P2 x x x -e 'O. A sheet of copper in the
 plane of the page is connected to a battery as shown above, causing
 electrons to drift through the copper toward the bottom of the page.
 The copper sheet is in a magnetic field B directed into the page. PI
 and P2 are points at the edges of the strip. Which of the following
 statements is true? (A) PI is at a higher potential than P2. (B) P2 is
 at a higher potential than Pl. (C) PI and P2 arc at equal positive
 potential. (D) PI and P2 are at equal negative potential. (E) Current
 will cease to flow in the copper sheet. ](./media/image565.png)
 
 ![Negative charge will shift to the left causing the right side to be
 at a higher potential, since potential is defined in terms of the
 positive charge. ](./media/image566.png)
