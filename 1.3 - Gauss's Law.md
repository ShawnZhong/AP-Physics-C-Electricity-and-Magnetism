# Gauss's Law

  -  Useful for finding the electric field due to charge distributions
     for cases of:
    
      -  Spherical Symmetry
    
      -  Cylindrical Symmetry
    
      -  Planar Symmetry

 ![Gauss's Law for Electric Fields from Fleisch Reminder that the
 electric field is a vector Reminder that this integral is over a
 closed surface Dot product tells you to find the part of E parallel to
 h (perpendicular to the surface) The unit vector normal to the surface
 Electric Flux Tells you to sum up the The electric field in N/C An
 increment of surface area in m2 The amount of net charge in coulombs
 Reminder that only the enclosed charge contributes The electric
 permittivity of the free space contributions from each Reminder that
 this is a surface portion of the surface integral (not a volume or a
 line integral) The flux of an electric field passing through any
 closed surface is proportional to the total charge contained within
 that surface. ](./media/image65.png)

# 2011 Free Response Question 1

 ![A nonconducting, thin, spherical shell has a uniform surface charge
 density on its outside surface and no charge anywhere else inside. (a)
 Use Gauss's law to prove that the electric field inside the shell is
 zero everywhere. Describe the Gaussian surface that you use. (b) The
 charges are now redistributed so that the surface charge density is no
 longer uniform. Is the electric field still zero everywhere inside the
 shell? Yes No It cannot be determined from the information given.
 Justify your answer. Now consider a small conducting sphere with
 charge +Q whose center is at corner A of a cubical surface, as shown
 below. (c) For which faces of the surface, if any, is the electric
 flux through that face equal to zero? ABCD CDEF EFGH ABGH BCFG ADEH
 Explain your reasoning. (d) At which corner(s) of the surface does the
 electric field have the least magnitude? (e) Determine the electric
 field strength at the position(s) you have indicated in part (d) in
 terms of Q, L, and fundamental constants, as appropriate. (f) Given
 that one-eighth of the sphere at point A is inside the surface,
 calculate the electric flux through face CDEF. ](./media/image75.png)
