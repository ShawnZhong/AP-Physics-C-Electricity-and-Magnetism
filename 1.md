# What is a Capacitor?

  - > A capacitor is an electric device used to store electrical energy
    
      - > Two conducting plates
    
      - > Insulating material between (dielectric)

  - > Place opposite charges on each plate

  - > Develop a potential difference across the plates

  - > Energy is stored in the electric field between the plates

> ![Conductive Parallel Plates Dielectric Voltage Vc Electrical Charge
> Symbo ](./media/image179.png)

# Capacitance

  - > Capacitance (C) is the ratio of the charge separated on the plates
    > of a capacitor to the potential difference between the plates

  - > Units of capacitance are coulombs/volt, or farads (F)
    
      - > A farad is a very large amount of capacitance

> ![To calculate capacitance, need to determine the E field between the
> plates. We use Gauss' Law, with one end of our gaussian surface closed
> inside one plate, and the other closed in the region between the
> plates Gauss: so q=eoEA or COA Potential = force/q x distance:
