# Inductors in Circuits

  -  When circuit is first turned on, inductor opposes current flow and
     act like an open circuit

  -  After a time, inductor keeps current going and acts as a short

  -  After a long time, if the battery is removed, the inductor acts as
     an emf source to keep the current going

  -  As the resistor dissipates power, the current will decay
     exponentially to zero.
