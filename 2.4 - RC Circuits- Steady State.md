# Capacitors in Parallel

  -  Capacitors store charge on their plates

  -  Capacitors in parallel can be replaced with an equivalent
     capacitor

# RC Circuits

  -  RC Circuits are circuits comprised of a source of potential
     difference, a resistor network, and one or more capacitors

  -  We will look at RC circuits from the steady-state perspective
    
      -  What happens when first turned on
    
      -  What happens after a "long" time has elapsed

  -  Key to understanding RC Circuit Performance
    
      -  Uncharged capacitors act like wires
    
      -  Charged capacitors act like opens
