# Question 4

  -  Eddy current brake

 ![However, unlike electro-mechanical brakes, in which the drag force
 used to stop the moving object is provided by friction between two
 surfaces pressed together, the drag force in an eddy current brake is
 an electromagnetic force between a magnet and a nearby conductive
 object in relative motion, due to eddy currents Eddy current brake -

 relative) Relative permeability, dimensionless (go=l for air) 1.26 x

  -  Derivation

 ![As the current in a coil of wire increases or decreases — aka,
 changes — the flux through the coil changes as well. This changing
 flux induces a back emf in the same coil. Since the change in flux is
 proportional to the change in the current, and opposes that change, we
 can write the relationship Ai At where L, the inductance, represents a
 proportionality constant that reflects the coil's geometry. Inductance
 is measured in a unit called a Henry (H) which is a V sec/amp or J
 sec2/C2. The most common inductor is a solenoid. Let's derive an
 expression for its inductance. An induced emf can be written as Ai or
 S — —L— At At Setting these two expressions equal to each other,
 yields Ai -L At At As the current changes from zero to l, the flux
 changes from zero to f, therefore Df= f and Di = I and our expression
 becomes BA A ,uonNA 10 A ](./media/image577.png)
 
 ![Notice that this expression, as predicted, deals only with the
 geometry of the solenoid: its cross-sectional area, length, and total
 number of coils. i-E/R 0.63i When an inductor is part of a circuit,
 the current does not instantaneously reach its maximum value of I =
 e/R, instead the current builds gradually depending on the ratio of
 L/R. ](./media/image578.png)

# Question 23

 not change Only direction changes Particle moves in a circle (if LB )
