# The Electroscope

  -  An electroscope is used to detect small electric charges based on
     conduction

# Polarization and Electric Dipole Moment

  -  When a charged object is brought near a conductor, the electrons
     in the conductor are free to move

  -  When a charged object is brought near an insulator, the electrons
     are not free to move, bu they may spend a little more time on the
     side of their orbit than another, creating a net separation of
     charge in a process known as **polarization**

  -  The distance between the shifted positive and negative charges,
     multiplied by the charge, is known as the **electric dipole
     moment**
