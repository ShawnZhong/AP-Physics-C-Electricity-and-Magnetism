# Electric Potential Energy

  -  When an object was lifted against gravity by applying a force for
     some distance, work was done to give that object gravitational
     potential energy

  -  When a charged object is moved against an electric field by
     applying a force for some distance, work is done to give that
     object electric potential energy.

  -  The work done per unit charge in moving a charge between two
     points in an electric field is a scalar known as the electric
     potential V (or voltage)
    
      -  Units: volts (1V = 1 J/C)
    
      -  The work done is equal to the change in the object's electric
         potential energy
         (U<sub>E</sub>)

# The Electron-Volt

  -  Oftentimes the electrical energy and/or work done is a very small
     portion of a joule

  -  A smaller, alternative, non-standard unit of energy is often used
     for convenience, known as the electron volt (eV)
    
      -  1 eV is the amount of work done in moving an elementary charge
         through a potential difference of 1
         volt

# Equipotential Lines

  -  Topographic maps show you lines of equal altitude, or equal
     gravitational potential

  -  Lines connecting points of equal electrical potential are known as
     equipotential lines.
    
      -  Equipotential lines always cross electrical field lines at
         right angles
    
      -  If you move a charged particle in space, and stay on an
         equipotential line, no work will be done.
    
      -  As equipotential lines get closer together, the gradients of
         the potential increases (stepper "slope" of potentials)
    
      -  Electric field points from high to low potential
