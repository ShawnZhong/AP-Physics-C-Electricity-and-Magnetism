 ![A uniform electric field of magnitude 250 V/m is directed in the
 positive x direction. A +12.0 pc charge moves from the origin to the
 point (x,y) = (20.0 cm, 50.0 cm). (a) What is the change in the
 potential energy of the charge-filed system? (b) Through what
 potential difference does the charge move? E = zsov/m APE E x x . -zom

# Question 3

  -  Solid conducting mettalic sphere and hollow sphere are same as
     charge resides on the outer surface of the sphere.

  -  Inside the sphere, field is zero. Outside the sphere, it behaves
     as a point charge placed at the centre of sphere.

  -  But the case of non-conducting sphere is different.

  -  Whole charge doesn't move to surface. Inside the sphere it is
     directly proportional to distance from centre. Outside it behaves
     as point charge at centre of sphere.
