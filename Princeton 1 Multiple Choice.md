 ![A copper wire in the shape of a circle of radius I m, lying in the
 plane of the page, is immersed in a mag- netic field, B, that points
 into the plane of the page. The strength of B varies with time, t,
 according to the equa- tion B(t) = 2t(1 - t) where B is given in
 teslas when t is measured in seconds. What is the magnitude of the
 induced electric field in the wire at time t = 1 s?

# Question 57

  -  Since the magnetic force is always perpendicular to the object’s
     velocity, it does zero work on any charged particle.

  -  Zero work means zero change in kinetic energy, so the speed
     remains the same.

  -  Remember: The magnetic force can only change the direction of a
     charged particle’s velocity, not its
 speed.

 ![If a conducting sphere contains a charge of + q within an inner
 cavity, a charge of —q will move to the wall of the cavity to "guard"
 the inte- rior of the sphere from an electrostatic field, regardless
 of the size, shape, or location of the cavity. As a result, a charge
 of +q is left on the exterior of the sphere (and it will be uniform).
 So, at points outside the sphere, the sphere behaves as if this charge
 + q were concentrated at its center, so the electric field outside is
 simply kQ/r . Since points X and Y are at the same distance from the
 center of the sphere, the elec- tric field strength at Y will be the
 same as at X. ](./media/image624.png)
