# [AP Physics C: Electricity and Magnetism](https://em.shawnzhong.com)
Notes and Exercises on Advanced Placement Physics C: Electricity and Magnetism. I took notes based on the videos tutorials at [educator.com](https://www.educator.com/physics/ap-physics-c-electricity-magnetism/fullerton/) and the past exams collected below. You can also download a PDF version of the notes  <a href="AP-Physics-C-Electricity-and-Magnetism.pdf"  target="_blank" >here</a>.
